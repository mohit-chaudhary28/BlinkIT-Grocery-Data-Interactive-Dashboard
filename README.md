# BlinkIT-Grocery-Data-Interactive-Dashboard
I created a comprehensive dashboard using Excel and PowerBI to analyze Blinkitâ€™s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The dashboard identifies key insights and opportunities for optimization through various KPIs and visualizations.

Insights: - 
1. Supermart Type 1 generates the highest sales.
2. Fruits and vegetables, snack foods, household items, and frozen food products account for the majority of sales.
3. Low-fat food products achieve the greatest sales and profits in Tier 2 outlets.

DISCLAIMER: - 
It's not the original data; it's a replica.
